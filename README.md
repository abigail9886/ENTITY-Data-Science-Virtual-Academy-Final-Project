# ENTITY Data Science Virtual Academy Final Project
 A repository to hold my files relating to my final project for the ENTITY Data Science Virtual Academy.

## Week 1 Deliverables
During Week 1 of the project, we were asked to complete several pre-planning documents, including choosing our dataset, identifying the variables, and writing a project proposal. Below are links to each of those expected deliverables.

1. [Week 1 - Getting to Know Your Team (DOCX)](https://github.com/aglisson6/ENTITY-Data-Science-Virtual-Academy-Final-Project/blob/main/Week%201%20-%20Get%20to%20Know%20Your%20Team.docx)
2. [Week 1 - Submit Your Dataset (CSV)](https://github.com/aglisson6/ENTITY-Data-Science-Virtual-Academy-Final-Project/blob/main/hour.csv) - This dataset was assigned to our group to all complete individual projects using the same set. The data will be used to predict hourly bike rentals based on seasonal and weather conditions.
3. [Week 1 - Analysis Planning Worksheet (DOCX)](https://github.com/aglisson6/ENTITY-Data-Science-Virtual-Academy-Final-Project/blob/main/Week%201%20-%20Analysis%20Planning%20Worksheet.docx)
4. [Week 1 - Project Proposal (DOCX)](https://github.com/aglisson6/ENTITY-Data-Science-Virtual-Academy-Final-Project/blob/main/Week%201%20-%20Project%20Proposal.docx)

## Week 2 Deliverables
During Week 2 of the project, we started with our initial coding to perform Data Wrangling as we could foresee for our intended analyses. We were also asked to complete a Progress Update document.

1. [Week 2 - Data Wrangling (Python Jupyter Notebook)](https://github.com/aglisson6/ENTITY-Data-Science-Virtual-Academy-Final-Project/blob/main/Week%202%20-%20Data%20Wrangling.ipynb) - This version of the code is a copy of my living code document that is intended to mark the progress in time. For the most up-to-date version of code as my work progresses, see below.
2. [Week 2 - Progress Update (DOCX)](https://github.com/aglisson6/ENTITY-Data-Science-Virtual-Academy-Final-Project/blob/main/Week%202%20-%20Project%20Progress%20Update.docx) - This document seeks to answer the required question prompts for each week of the project progression.

## In-Progress Project File
My most up-to-date living project file can be found [HERE](https://github.com/aglisson6/ENTITY-Data-Science-Virtual-Academy-Final-Project/blob/main/Abi_Glisson%20-%20Final%20Project%20-%20Python.ipynb). I will work in this Jupyter Notebook for the duration of the project, to end with a fully commented and explained file demonstrating the complete data science pipeline.
